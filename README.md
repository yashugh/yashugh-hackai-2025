# ðŸ“Š Annual Report Assistant â€” HackAI 2025

## ðŸ§  Problem Statement
Annual reports are packed with valuable insights about a companyâ€™s financials, strategy, and performance. However, these reports are often long, complex, and hard to understand quickly â€” especially for investors, researchers, and business analysts.

## ðŸŽ¯ Our Goal
Build an AI-powered app that can automatically:
- Read and understand uploaded annual report PDFs
- Answer questions users ask in natural language (Q&A)
- Extract and summarize content from charts, tables, and text
- Help users gain key insights efficiently without reading the whole document

## ðŸ’¼ Real-World Use Cases
- Investors doing company analysis
- Financial journalists needing quick facts
- Business students learning report analysis
- Compliance officers reviewing key highlights

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Matters
Automating this process reduces hours of manual reading and allows non-experts to access crucial financial insights in seconds.
